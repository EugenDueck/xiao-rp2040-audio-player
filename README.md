# Notes
- this program currently plays up to 16 bit sample files at an arbitrary, fixed sample rate
  - the bundled samples.h file has a sample rate of 44.1kHz and a dynamic range of 3015 values (~ 11.6 bits)
- 8 bit sound was pretty noisy when compared to the 16 bit original, 11.6 bits are so much less noisy than 8 bits
  - I also tried the following circuit from [here](https://theorycircuit.com/simple-single-transistor-audio-amplifier-circuit/), which features a resistor/capacitor combo, as is common in amp circuits, but sound did not improve - to my ears
![Simple Single Transistor Audio Amplifier Circuit](https://theorycircuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Simple-single-transistor-audio-amplifier-circuit.png)
- the range of the PIR sensor was way too high (up to 7m), so I put a couple of [polyethylene sheets](#5-polyethylene-bags-0-03mm-3-85-yen-77-yen-20) in front of it
  - this meant there weren't any false alarms in my tests on the street where I plan to use it (though I'm sure there will be some in practice), so I could disable the "5 second averaging" smooting mechanism in my code, which leads to a less delayed reaction to motion

# Build instructions
- install pico-sdk (to ~/pico-sdk)
  - if pico-sdk is located in a different directory, change PICO_SDK_PATH in CMakeLists.txt
- if using a board other than seeed_xiao_rp2040, set PICO_BOARD in CMakeLists.txt accordingly
- make XIAO accessible via USB mass storage: while pressing and holding the BOOT button, press the RESET button
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

# deploy binary: (assuming the XIAO is mounted at /media/$USERNAME/RPI-RP2)
cp xiao-rp2040-audio-player.uf2 /media/$USERNAME/RPI-RP2/
```

# Convert audio file to samples.h
The *rate* parameter `-r` below can changed, but don't forget to set `SAMPLE_RATE` in main.c accordingly
```
SAMPLE_RATE=44100 # Hz
SAMPLE_BITS=16
INPUT_FILE=teatime.flac
PWM_WRAP=3015
sox $INPUT_FILE -c1 -r$SAMPLE_RATE -tdat - \
| tail -n+3 \
| awk '
    BEGIN {
        mul='$PWM_WRAP'/2.0
        printf "// input file: '$INPUT_FILE'\n"
        printf "#define SAMPLE_RATE '$SAMPLE_RATE'\n"
        printf "#define SAMPLE_BITS '$SAMPLE_BITS'\n"
        printf "#define PWM_WRAP '$PWM_WRAP'\n"
        printf "const uint'$SAMPLE_BITS'_t __in_flash() audio_buffer[] = {\n"
    }
  { printf "  %.0f,\n", ($2 + 1) * mul }
  END { printf "};\n"}' \

## Transistor 2SC4408

[Datasheet](https://cdn.datasheetspdf.com/pdf-down/C/4/4/C4408_ToshibaSemiconductor.pdf)

### Alternative transistor: 2SD2012

After heating up my 2SC4408 too much during soldering - at least that's what I'm guessing - it stopped amplifying, so I went for this transistor, that I had lying around.

## Variable Resistor 10kΩ

## 5 Polyethylene bags 0.03mm [3.85 Yen (77 Yen / 20)](https://store.shopping.yahoo.co.jp/oyakudachi-shop/taiyoupori-2-kakuhaibin.html)
- each of the 5 bags conists of 2 layers of 0.03mm polyethylene sheet, folded in half means we get a total thickness of `2 x 2 x 5 x 0.03mm = 0.6mm`
